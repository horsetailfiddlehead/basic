Repo: basic.git

This repo is reserved for basic setup and configuration files that I may want accessible from remote locations.

IMPORTANT: many configuration files are probabaly hidden, so if you can't find it, try enabling any options to view hidden files.

Setup of the repo:
1) Download this repo from Dropbox or Github.
2) Create a new file with the proper name (i.e.: .bashrc, .gitignore, etc.)
3) Link the file to the file in this repo (do not move the file, or it will not update properly)
4) Alternately, instruct the file to source the associated file in this repo.

TODO: Here's things I want to add and modify in this file
* put the rest of my config files in
* create a make file or script that automatically moves config files to the home directory (or where ever the config file is sourced from).
* create a python version of the make file, as Make is not natively packaged with gitBash
