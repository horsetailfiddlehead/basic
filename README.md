Repo: basic.git

This repo is reserved for basic setup and configuration files that I may want accessible from remote locations.

IMPORTANT: many configuration files are probabaly hidden, so if you can't find it, try enabling any options to view hidden files.


TODO: Here's things I want to add and modify in this file
* put the rest of my config files in
* create a make file or script that automatically moves config files to the home directory (or where ever the config file is sourced from).
